BUG
- live update crashing for when very large dimension entered...

General
- see if we can reduce tutorial pixelsize, probably overkill, causing oom


Sim
- memory leak #37
- Beam refactor [#34](https://github.com/DeMarcoLab/juno/issues/34)

UI
- clear napari notifications
- load custom 'element' profiles in UI
- Gaussian beam not displaying correctly, likely napari interpolation (need to verify)
- select from table click
- metadata: make loading metadata loading / saving work from all paths (relative / abs)
- axicon visualisation is not showing correctly, likely due to napari interpolation
- sort results table
- make pathing work regardless of where sim was run... 
- remove tmp dir one Beam Creation close...
